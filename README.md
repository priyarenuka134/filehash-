filehash is a package in R

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit,
Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the “quantified self” movement – a group of enthusiasts who take 
measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. 
But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software 
for processing and interpreting the data.


 Dataset : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip
 
The variables included in this dataset are:

1. steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as \color{red}{\verb|NA|}NA)
2. date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
3. interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
 
full submission :

1. Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
2. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
3. Mean and median number of steps taken each day
4. Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
5. The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
6. Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
7. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
8. Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
9. All of the R code needed to reproduce the results (numbers, plots, etc.) in the report
